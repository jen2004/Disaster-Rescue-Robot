# Disaster-Rescue-Robot

I completed this project during my 5th semester at WGU as a part of the class Introduction to Artificial Intelligence C951.

LifeBot is an innovative search-and-rescue robot designed to enhance disaster recovery during fire emergencies. Created using CoppeliaSim’s "bubbleRob" as a base, LifeBot operates within a simulated environment of a house engulfed in flames, equipped with proximity sensors for navigation and human detection. The robot’s reactive design allows it to navigate around obstacles, such as furniture, and promptly alert rescue personnel when a human is located, providing their exact position. This efficiency minimizes the time rescue workers spend in hazardous conditions, improving safety and reducing response times.

For the complete project requirements, please refer to the “Task 2 Overview.pdf” file.

For my complete project report, refer to “Task 2 Report.pdf”.

Here is a GIF of LifeBot in use. The sensor turns from blue to green when a human (red cylinder) is detected.
